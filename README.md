# OverTheWire-Launcher
This is a fan-made launcher used to help clean some stuff up and make playing OverTheWire more digestable! 
I made this one day because I was lazy and wanted to speed up the process of things, as well as have 
a way of saving passwords. I do not own or work for overthewire. All the levels are from them.
You will need to go to their website in order to get more information for each level, but I have some 
tips if you want a little boost. I have a couple options that explain themselves. You can start from
level 0 and go from there. Or you can select from a level you have already beaten. In order to go to 
beaten levels you will need to store your passwords. All that is handled here in the launcher. Feel
free to share this with friends, this is very helpful for those very new to linux that want a more UI 
friendly way of learning Linux. Thanks and have fun!
